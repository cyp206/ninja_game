                        Security Safeguards. Xi Yang Yang Company takes reasonable measures to protect your information from
                        unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties. Although we make
                        good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Services in a secure operating
                        environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security
                        of that information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we
                        attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee
                        that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining
                        access to this information. We do not warrant or represent that your information will be
                        protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission
                        over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we
                        cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><br>
